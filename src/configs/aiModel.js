The installation process varies slightly depending on your operating system:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Windows:</b>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: <a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/\">https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/</a></li>\n            <li>Run the installer. <b>Important:</b> Make sure to check the \"Add Python to PATH\" option during installation. This will allow you to run Python from the command line.</li>\n            <li>After installation, open the command prompt (cmd) and type <code>python --version</code> to verify that Python is installed correctly.</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li><b>macOS:</b>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: <a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/\">https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/</a></li>\n            <li>Run the installer.</li>\n            <li>Open the terminal and type <code>python3 --version</code> to verify that Python is installed correctly. On macOS, you often need to use <code>python3</code> instead of <code>python</code>.</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li><b>Linux:</b>\n        <p>Python is usually pre-installed on most Linux distributions. If not, you can install it using your distribution's package manager (e.g., <code>apt</code> for Debian/Ubuntu, <code>yum</code> for Fedora/CentOS).</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>For Debian/Ubuntu: <code>sudo apt update</code> followed by <code>sudo apt install python3</code></li>\n            <li>For Fedora/CentOS: <code>sudo yum install python3</code></li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Verify the installation by typing <code>python3 --version</code> in the terminal.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Running Your First Python Program</h3>\n<p>Let's write a simple \"Hello, World!\" program:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, Sublime Text).</li>\n    <li>Type the following code:\n        <pre><code>print(\"Hello, World!\")</code></pre>\n    </li>\n    <li>Save the file with a <code>.py</code> extension (e.g., <code>hello.py</code>).</li>\n    <li>Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the program using the command <code>python hello.py</code> (or <code>python3 hello.py</code> on macOS and Linux).</li>\n    <li>You should see \"Hello, World!\" printed on the console.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Understanding Variables</h3>\n<p>A variable is a named storage location that holds a value.  You can assign values to variables using the <code>=</code> operator.  Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code>\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 30\npi = 3.14159\n\nprint(name)  # Output: Alice\nprint(age)   # Output: 30\nprint(pi)    # Output: 3.14159\n</code></pre>\n<p>Variable names should be descriptive and follow these rules:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Start with a letter or underscore (<code>_</code>).</li>\n    <li>Contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.</li>\n    <li>Be case-sensitive (<code>myVariable</code> and <code>myvariable</code> are different).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Data Types (Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans)</h3>\n<p>Python has several built-in data types:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Integers (<code>int</code>):</b> Whole numbers (e.g., <code>-5</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>10</code>).</li>\n    <li><b>Floats (<code>float</code>):</b> Decimal numbers (e.g., <code>3.14</code>, <code>-2.5</code>, <code>0.0</code>).</li>\n    <li><b>Strings (<code>str</code>):</b> Sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes (e.g., <code>\"Hello\"</code>, <code>'Python'</code>).</li>\n    <li><b>Booleans (<code>bool</code>):</b> Represent truth values, either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can determine the data type of a variable using the <code>type()</code> function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nage = 30\nprice = 99.99\nmessage = \"Hello, Python!\"\nis_valid = True\n\nprint(type(age))      # Output: &ltclass 'int'&gt\nprint(type(price))    # Output: &ltclass 'float'&gt\nprint(type(message))  # Output: &ltclass 'str'&gt\nprint(type(is_valid)) # Output: &ltclass 'bool'&gt\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Basic Operators (+, -, *, /, %)</h3>\n<p>Python supports standard arithmetic operators:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Addition (<code>+</code>):</b> Adds two values.</li>\n    <li><b>Subtraction (<code>-</code>):</b> Subtracts the second value from the first.</li>\n    <li><b>Multiplication (<code>*</code>):</b> Multiplies two values.</li>\n    <li><b>Division (<code>/</code>):</b> Divides the first value by the second. The result is always a float.</li>\n    <li><b>Modulo (<code>%</code>):</b> Returns the remainder of the division of the first value by the second.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<pre><code>\nx = 10\ny = 3\n\nprint(x + y)   # Output: 13\nprint(x - y)   # Output: 7\nprint(x * y)   # Output: 30\nprint(x / y)   # Output: 3.3333333333333335\nprint(x % y)   # Output: 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Working with the <code>print()</code> Function</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>print()</code> function is used to display output to the console.  You can print strings, variables, and expressions.  You can also format the output.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nname = \"Bob\"\nage = 25\n\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name + \"! You are \" + str(age) + \" years old.\") # String concatenation\n\n# Using f-strings (formatted string literals)\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n\n# Using the .format() method\nprint(\"Hello, {}! You are {} years old.\".format(name, age))\n</code></pre>\n<p>All three print statements above produce the same output: \"Hello, Bob! You are 25 years old.\"</p>\n<p>Other important arguments to the <code>print()</code> function are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>sep</code>: specifies how the printed values are separated, default is a space</li>\n<li><code>end</code>: specifies what is printed at the end of the output, default is a newline</li>\n</ul>\n\n<pre><code>\nprint(\"apples\", \"bananas\", \"cherries\", sep=\", \", end=\"!\\n\") #prints: apples, bananas, cherries!\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Comments in Python</h3>\n<p>Comments are used to explain your code and make it more readable.  Python supports two types of comments:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Single-line comments:</b> Start with a <code>#</code> symbol and continue to the end of the line.</li>\n    <li><b>Multi-line comments (docstrings):</b> Enclosed in triple quotes (<code>\"\"\"</code> or <code>'''</code>).  These are often used to document functions and classes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<pre><code>\n# This is a single-line comment.\n\n\"\"\"\nThis is a multi-line comment (docstring).\nIt can span multiple lines and is often used to\ndescribe the purpose of a function or a class.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef greet(name):\n    \"\"\"Greets the person passed in as a parameter.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ngreet(\"Charlie\")  # This is another single-line comment.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>üêç Control Flow and Loops</h1>\n\n<h2>Summary:</h2>\n<p>Master conditional statements and loops to create more dynamic and interactive programs.</p>\n\n<h2>Topics:</h2>\n\n<h3><code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, <code>else</code> statements</h3>\n<p>Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. The basic structure is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nif condition:\n    # Code to execute if the condition is true\nelif another_condition:\n    # Code to execute if the first condition is false and this condition is true\nelse:\n    # Code to execute if all conditions are false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nage = 20\n\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"You are an adult.\")\nelif age >= 13:\n    print(\"You are a teenager.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are a child.\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Comparison Operators (<code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>>=</code>)</h3>\n\n<p>Comparison operators are used to compare values.  They return a boolean result (<code>True</code> or <code>False</code>).</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><code>==</code>: Equal to</li>\n    <li><code>!=</code>: Not equal to</li>\n    <li><code>&lt;</code>: Less than</li>\n    <li><code>&gt;</code>: Greater than</li>\n    <li><code>&lt;=</code>: Less than or equal to</li>\n    <li><code>>=</code>: Greater than or equal to</li>\n</ul>\n\n<pre><code>\nx = 10\ny = 5\n\nprint(x == y)  # Output: False\nprint(x != y)  # Output: True\nprint(x &lt; y)   # Output: False\nprint(x &gt; y)   # Output: True\nprint(x &lt;= y)  # Output: False\nprint(x >= y)  # Output: True\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Logical Operators (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>)</h3>\n\n<p>Logical operators are used to combine or negate boolean expressions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><code>and</code>: Returns <code>True</code> if both operands are <code>True</code>.</li>\n    <li><code>or</code>: Returns <code>True</code> if at least one operand is <code>True</code>.</li>\n    <li><code>not</code>: Returns the opposite boolean value of the operand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<pre><code>\nage = 25\nis_student = True\n\nif age >= 18 and is_student:\n    print(\"You are an adult student.\")\n\nif age &lt; 18 or is_student:\n    print(\"You are either under 18 or a student.\")\n\nis_employed = False\nif not is_employed:\n    print(\"You are not employed.\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3><code>for</code> loops</h3>\n\n<p>A <code>for</code> loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\n# Iterating over a list\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n\n# Iterating over a range\nfor i in range(5):  # Generates numbers from 0 to 4\n    print(i)\n\n#Iterating over string\nword = \"Python\"\nfor char in word:\n    print(char)\n\n# using else after the for loop is complete:\nfor number in range(5):\n  print(number)\nelse:\n  print(\"Loop finished successfully!\")  #This will execute after loop\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3><code>while</code> loops</h3>\n<p>A <code>while</code> loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is <code>True</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\ncount = 0\nwhile count &lt; 5:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1 # or count = count + 1\n\n#using else after while loop condition gets false\nnumber = 1\nwhile number &lt;= 5:\n    print(number)\n    number += 1\nelse:\n    print(\"Loop complete!\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3><code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements</h3>\n\n<p><code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> are used to control the flow of loops.</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><code>break</code>: Exits the loop immediately.</li>\n    <li><code>continue</code>: Skips the current iteration and continues to the next iteration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<pre><code>\n# Using break\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i == 5:\n        break  # Exit the loop when i is 5\n    print(i)\n\n# Using continue\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        continue  # Skip even numbers\n    print(i)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>üóÑÔ∏è Working with Data Structures</h1>\n\n<h2>Summary:</h2>\n<p>Learn to handle data effectively using lists, tuples, and dictionaries.</p>\n\n<h2>Topics:</h2>\n\n<h3>Lists: Creation, Access, Modification</h3>\n<p>A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items.

                  "answer": "Flutter is a UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. You should use Flutter because it offers fast development with hot reload, beautiful and customizable widgets, excellent performance, and the ability to build for multiple platforms with a single codebase. For example, you can write code once and deploy it to both iOS and Android, saving significant development time and resources."

                  "question": "What is the difference between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget?",
                  "answer": "A StatelessWidget is immutable, meaning its properties can't change after creation. It's used for UI elements that don't need to maintain any state. A StatefulWidget, on the other hand, can maintain state that might change during the widget's lifetime. For example, a simple text display would use StatelessWidget, while a counter that needs to update its value would use StatefulWidget."

                  "question": "How does Flutter handle state management?",
                  "answer": "Flutter offers several approaches to state management: setState for simple state management, Provider for dependency injection and state management, Bloc for complex state management with separation of business logic, and Redux for predictable state management. The choice depends on your app's complexity. For example, a simple app might use setState, while a complex app might benefit from Bloc or Redux."

                {
                  "question": "What are Flutter widgets and how do they work?",
                  "answer": "Widgets are the basic building blocks of Flutter UI. Everything in Flutter is a widget, from structural elements like Container and Row to visual elements like Text and Image. Widgets are organized in a tree structure, where each widget can have child widgets. For example, a Container widget might contain a Column widget, which in turn contains multiple Text widgets."

                  "question": "How do you handle navigation in Flutter?",
                  "answer": "Flutter provides the Navigator class for handling navigation between screens. You can use Navigator.push() to navigate to a new screen and Navigator.pop() to go back. For named routes, you can use Navigator.pushNamed(). For example: Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()));"
                },
                {
                  "question": "What is the purpose of the build method in Flutter?",
                  "answer": "The build method is a required method in both StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget. It describes how to display the widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets. The build method is called whenever the widget needs to be rebuilt, such as when its state changes or when its parent widget rebuilds."
                },
                {
                  "question": "How do you handle user input in Flutter?",
                  "answer": "Flutter provides various widgets for handling user input, such as TextField for text input, ElevatedButton for buttons, and GestureDetector for touch events. You can also use Form widgets for form validation. For example, a TextField widget can be used to collect user input and update state accordingly."
                },
                {
                  "question": "What is the difference between main() and runApp() in Flutter?",
                  "answer": "main() is the entry point of a Flutter application, while runApp() is a function that inflates the given widget and attaches it to the screen. The main() function typically calls runApp() with the root widget of the application. For example: void main() { runApp(MyApp()); }"
                },
                {
                  "question": "How do you handle asynchronous operations in Flutter?",
                  "answer": "Flutter uses async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations. You can use Future for single asynchronous operations and Stream for continuous data. For example, to fetch data from an API, you would use async/await with http package: Future<void> fetchData() async { final response = await http.get(url); }"

                  "answer": "The pubspec.yaml file is the configuration file for a Flutter project. It defines the project's dependencies, assets, and metadata. It's used to manage external packages, specify Flutter SDK version, and declare assets like images and fonts. For example, to add a package, you would add it under the dependencies section: dependencies: http: ^0.13.0"
